Students in this class are introduced to computer science and learn the basics of front-end web development. By the end of the Unit I course, each student will have compiled a portfolio of HTML/CSS projects, including a dynamic personal webpage, which they will host on Github pages. The second unit is more advanced Python and Javascript. Students focus more on programming logic and problem solving by working through small to medium projects. At the end, students will pick a final project, which can either be a Python program or a website that implements Javascript. With both groups, the instructors encourage students to try new things, ask for help when needed, and to help their peers. Transferable skills like presenting and public speaking, and typing are also a focus of this program."
